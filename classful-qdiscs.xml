  <title>分类排队规则(&linux-qdisc;)</title>
  <para>
    The flexibility and control of Linux traffic control can be unleashed
    through the agency of the classful qdiscs.  Remember that the classful
    queuing disciplines can have filters attached to them, allowing packets to
    be directed to particular classes and subqueues.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are several common terms to describe classes directly attached to
    the &root-qdisc; and terminal classes.  Classess attached to the
    &root-qdisc; are known as root classes, and more generically inner
    classes.  Any terminal class in a particular queuing discipline is known
    as a leaf class by analogy to the tree structure of the classes.  Besides
    the use of figurative language depicting the structure as a tree, the
    language of family relationships is also quite common.

    <title>HTB, Hierarchical Token Bucket</title>
    <para>
      &sch_htb; uses the concepts of tokens and buckets
      along with the class-based system and &linux-filter;s to allow for
      complex and granular control over traffic.  With a complex
      &link-htb-borrowing;, &sch_htb; can perform a variety of sophisticated
      traffic control techniques.  One of the easiest ways to use &sch_htb;
      immediately is that of &link-htb-shaping;.
    </para>
    <para>
      By understanding &concepts-tokens; and &concepts-buckets; or by grasping
      the function of &link-sch_tbf;, &sch_htb; should be merely a logical
      step.  This queuing discipline allows the user to define the
      characteristics of the tokens and bucket used and allows the user to
      nest these buckets in an arbitrary fashion.  When coupled with a
      &elements-classifying; scheme, traffic can be controlled in a very
      granular fashion.

        Unlike almost all of the other software discussed, &sch_htb; is a
        newer queuing discipline and your distribution may not have all of the
        tools and capability you need to use &sch_htb;.  The kernel must
        support &sch_htb;; kernel version 2.4.20 and later support it in the
        stock distribution, although earlier kernel versions require patching.

        All shaping occurs in leaf classes.  No shaping occurs in inner or
        root classes as they only exist to suggest how the

      <title>Borrowing</title>
      <para>
        A fundamental part of the &sch_htb; qdisc is the borrowing mechanism.
        Children classes borrow tokens from their parents once they have
        exceeded &link-htb-param-rate;.  A child class will continue to
        attempt to borrow until it reaches &link-htb-param-ceil;, at which
        point it will begin to queue packets for transmission until more
        tokens/ctokens are available.  As there are only two primary types of
        classes which can be created with &sch_htb; the following table and
        diagram identify the various possible states and the behaviour of the
        borrowing mechanisms.

      <para>
        This diagram identifies the flow of borrowed tokens and the manner in
        which tokens are charged to parent classes.  In order for the
        borrowing model to work, each class must have an accurate count of the
        number of tokens used by itself and all of its children.  For this
        reason, any token used in a child or leaf class is charged to each
        parent class until the root class is reached.
      </para>
      <para>
        Any child class which wishes to borrow a token will request a token
        from its parent class, which if it is also over its &param-rate; will
        request to borrow from its parent class until either a token is
        located or the root class is reached.  So the borrowing of tokens
        flows toward the leaf classes and the charging of the usage of tokens
        flows toward the root class.

            Because &sch_htb; does not shape in any class except the leaf
            class, the sum of the &param-rate;s of leaf classes should not
            exceed the &param-ceil; of a parent class.  Ideally, the sum of
            the &param-rate;s of the children classes would match the
            &param-rate; of the parent class, allowing the parent class to
            distribute leftover bandwidth (&param-ceil; - &param-rate;) among
            the children classes.
