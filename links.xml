        Hierarchical Token Bucket, &link-sch_htb;, is a classful queuing
        discipline.  Widely used and supported it is also fairly well
        documented in the user guide and at

        There is a good deal of understandable and introductory documentation
        on his site, and in particular has some excellent overview material.
        See in particular, the detailed
        <ulink url="http://opalsoft.net/qos/DS.htm">Linux QoS</ulink> document
        among others.

      <para>
        The &tcng; software includes a language and a set of tools for
        creating and testing traffic control structures.  In addition to
        generating &tc; commands as output, it is also capable of providing
        output for non-Linux applications.  A key piece of the &tcng; suite
        which is ignored in this documentation is the <command>tcsim</command>
        traffic control simulator.
      </para>
      <para>
        The user manual provided with the &tcng; software has been converted
        to HTML with <command>latex2html</command>.  The distribution comes
        with the TeX documentation.

      <para>
        This is a the source code for the &iproute2; suite, which includes the
        essential &tc; binary.  Note, that as of
        iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss020116-try.tar.gz, the package did not support
        &sch_htb;, so a patch available from the &url-qdisc-htb; site will be
        required.

        The manual documents the entire suite of tools, although the &tc;

        Stef Coene has been gathering statistics and test results, scripts and

        control at Stef's site.

        The Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control HOWTO is one of the key
        sources of data about the sophisticated techniques which are available
        for use under Linux.  The Traffic Control Introduction HOWTO should
        provide the reader with enough background in the language and concepts
        of traffic control.  The LARTC HOWTO is the next place the reader
        should look for general traffic control information.

        Werner Almesberger is one of the main developers and champions of
        traffic control under Linux (he's also the author of &tcng;, above).
        One of the key documents describing the entire traffic control
        architecture of the Linux kernel is his Linux Traffic Control -
        Implementation Overview which is available in

      <blockquote>
         Differentiated Services (short: Diffserv) is an architecture for
         providing different types or levels of service for network traffic.
         One key characteristic of Diffserv is that flows are aggregated in
         the network, so that core routers only need to distinguish a
         comparably small number of aggregated flows, even if those flows
         contain thousands or millions of individual flows.
